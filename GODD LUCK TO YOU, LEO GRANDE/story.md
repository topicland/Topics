She is insecure about her body and age |  and embarrassed at having hired Leo |  and he tries to put her at ease.Leo expresses no shame about sex work |  but he reveals that his mother believes him to be an oil rig worker. Nancy shares that she is disappointed in her adult children |  adding that she is a retired religious education teacher. Her husband was her only sexual partner and found oral sex demeaning |  and they never deviated from unfulfilling missionary sex for thirty-one years together.Nancy recounts her most sensual experience: as a teenager on a family holiday in Greece |  a hotel worker took an interest in her; alone in the garden |  he began kissing and fingering her before being interrupted |  and she left the following day. Seeing Nancy aroused and relaxed by her own story |  Leo kisses and fingers her." |  |  |
| "GODD LUCK TO YOU |  LEO GRANDE" | Mainline | Forth Session | "Nancy books Leo for a fourth session |  arranging to meet in the hotel's cafe where their waitress |  Becky |  turns out to be her former student. Nancy thanks Leo for her newfound confidence and sexual awakening |  and has discreetly recommended him to several friends.

Becky interrupts with a story about Nancy shaming her and her friends for their short skirts |  calling them ""sluts"". |

| Leo has revealed his job to his brother |  reconnecting with him |  and explains that his mother disowned him after catching him and several friends having group sex; she no longer acknowledges his existence |  even walking past him in the street. Nancy apologises to Becky for her past judgmental behaviour |  confessing her real relationship to Leo and recommending his services. |
|  |
| Nancy and Leo enjoy a final session in their room |  passionately engaging in all the remaining acts on Nancy's list |  but she is still yet to orgasm. While Leo looks for a sex toy |  Nancy watches him walk around naked and masturbates |  giving herself her first orgasm.

She remains anxious |  worsened by phone calls from her daughter |  but Leo relaxes her through dancing and a massage. Fearing that she sacrificed her youth and potential adventures for her family |  she is overwhelmed after touching a shirtless Leo |  who encourages her to embrace her own body. |
